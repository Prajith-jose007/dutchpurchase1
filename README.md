# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running Locally

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js (version 18 or later) installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm**: This project uses `npm` as the package manager, which comes with Node.js.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Once you have the code on your local machine, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

The project uses a `.env` file for environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project. For now, the app can run without any specific variables, but you would add things like API keys here.

```
# .env file
# Add any environment variables here if needed in the future.
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

To start the Next.js development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application, typically on `http://localhost:9002`. You can open this URL in your browser to see the running application. The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the code.
